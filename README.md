# Responsive Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description 

This repository is comprised of a three page portfolio website that includes an About Me, Portfolio/Picture, and Contact page. Each page is styled with a CSS file.

These pages emphasize the incorporation of Bootsrap utilities (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) as well as the use of responsive images, proper grid layout formatting, and mobile accessibility. Therefore, the maintenance of proper format through various screen sizes is stressed in this project.

There was no additional Javascript added to this code aside from what was linked from the Boostrap library. 

The Bootstrap content and components used in this portfolio are a Navbar, a Form, and Responsive Images. Additional features include, hover image text, social media links and icons, Google Fonts, and a sticky footer.
