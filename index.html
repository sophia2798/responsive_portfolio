            <p>I was born in Bellevue, WA on April 27, 1998. I have one older brother named Peter and two dogs named Susha and Sienna. I moved to South Korea for a year when I was 7 years old, but otherwise have lived in Washington for my whole life. I went to college at the University of Washington and graduated with a degree in Applied Physics in June of 2020! I am always open to learning new things and meeting new people as I believe that creating diverse networks can provide a better means to approach the world's problems.</p>
            <p>I am a music lover and have yet to come across a style of music I don't like. I enjoy playing the piano, singing, and going to concerts and music festivals. I also love food and reading so recommendations in both areas are always welcome. Some of my favorite books include the Dune Series, Fahrenheit 451, Flowers for Algernon, Jane Eyre, and Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy. </p>
